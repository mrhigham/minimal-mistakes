Ensure there is always a clear call-to-action on content. If the content is video, there should be a play button/link clearly visible and associated with the image/tile depicting it.

Video: action comprising of the play icon, the word ‘Play’, and the duration of the video. These three elements can be arranged in various ways depending on the required design, but they should all be present. (Note, there could be times when the duration is less relevant or tricky to include.)

Less instructional text / messages, more repeatable and recognised interfaces.
