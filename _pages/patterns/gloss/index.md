title: "Gloss"
excerpt: "Use this pattern to attach a translation and an audio pronunciation guide to single words in a sentence."

Te Papa uses New Zealand English for all written content. This includes many Māori words that many New Zealanders know, such as hangi, haka, hui, and iwi.

Visitors to the museum come from many backgrounds and nations, and may not understand these words, even when used in context.

To aid understanding, and support learning Māori, we will provide a ‘gloss’ facility to enable visitors to find out what each word means, and how it is pronounced.

This facility will also be used to extend use of Māori within exhibition writing.

Within a digital interactive, Māori words will be clickable. Clicking opens a popup that includes a translation and an option to hear the word spoken.
