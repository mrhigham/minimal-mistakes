title: "Gloss"
excerpt: "Use this pattern to attach a translation and an audio pronunciation guide to single words in a sentence."

Te Papa uses New Zealand English for all written content. This includes many reo Māori words that many New Zealanders know, such as hangi, haka, hui, and iwi.

Visitors to the museum come from many backgrounds and nations, and may not understand these words, even when used in context.

To aid understanding, and support reo Māori learning, we will provide a ‘gloss’ facility to enable visitors to find out what each word means, and how it is pronounced.

This facility will also be used to extend use of te reo Māori within exhibition writing.

Within a digital interactive, such words will be clickable, with the click event opening a popup that includes a translation and an option to hear the word spoken.

EDIT: Add example of design pattern
