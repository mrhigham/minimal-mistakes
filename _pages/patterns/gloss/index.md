title: "Gloss"
excerpt: "Use this pattern to attach a translation and an audio pronunciation guide to single words in a sentence."

We want to encourage users to encounter te reo Māori, even when they are reading English. To do this, we can add Māori words into English text and use the `gloss` component to provide an in-context definition and pronunciation audio clip.

__Figure:__ The `gloss`component enables us to insert Māori words into English sentences to encourage language learning and aid with tranlsations.

Inserting unfamiliar words into text can (and should) disrupt readers, it is important to use them with care. Some guidelines are:

- Nouns work best.
- Do not start a sentence with a gloss.
- Do not use a gloss in headings or on interactive elements.
- Keep to a maximum of 1 gloss per paragraph.
- If a gloss is used for the word `taonga`, as an example, all instances of `taonga` should be in a gloss for the entire interactive.

The intent of the `gloss` component is to actively encourage Māori language learning for non-Māori speakers. This differs from the `language-toggle` component which switches the language of the _entire interactive_, which will be used by fluent speakers.
