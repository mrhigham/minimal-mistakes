excerpt: "Design for all users in mind."

For wall-mounted screens, all actions should be positioned within the bottom half of the screen. Typically, screens are hung on a 1.5m centre line. New Zealand Access Standards ([NZS 4121:2001](https://www.standards.govt.nz/assets/Publication-files/NZS4121-2001.pdf)) state that people in wheelchairs can typically reach 1350mm from side on (note, this typical reach height is lower when the screen is approached from front on).

As a rule, keep all interactive hotspots in the **bottom half of a wall-mounted screen** to ensure the screen remains as accessible as possible.

### Alternative

Sometimes there might be a compelling reason to have interactive hotspots in the top half of the screen, especially during content selection of multiple items. In this instanced, provide a secondary way to navigate the content using an accessible detached set of controls.
