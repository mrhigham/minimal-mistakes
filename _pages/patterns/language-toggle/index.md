Te Papa provides written content for all digital interactives in **Te reo M훮ori** and **English**.

### Key features of the `language-toggle` component are:

- M훮ori should appear first (on the left), followed by English.
- The current convention is to place the `language-toggle` in the top right of the interactive in alignment with the `Home` button (if present).
- The `language-toggle` should be present on most, if not all, pages. An exception to this convention might be on a fullscreen **Gallery** or **Image Zoom** page. Using the component on such a page would detract from the fullscreen design. These pages are likely to be nested within a page on which the toggle was present.
- Selecting a language should change the language _on the current page_ (in other words, this should not change the page itself or return the interactive to Home, but should only change the language being displayed).

If more langugages are required, other options might need to be explored to avoid cluttering the interface.
