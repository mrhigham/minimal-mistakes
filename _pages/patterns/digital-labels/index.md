## Wireframe overview

![Digital labels wireframe](/images/digital-label-wireframe.png)

Wireframe showing basic interaction for a digital label: menu screen and detail screen.
{: .figcaption}

### Menu screen

* [Natural mapping](/_pages/principles/layout/) if possible
* If there is a large number of items to select from, consider splitting them into separate menu pages that can be navigated using Previous and Next buttons. Aim to split the items into groups that relate in some way to their physical display (eg, separate cases of objects).

### Detail screen

Actions available:

* Title
* Image
* Body content (text, images, video)
* Lateral navigation (next and previous articles)

## Uniform title

Ensure the same title for an object is used in all of the places it is referred to. For example:

* The __physical object label__ positioned by an object
* The title of the digital content on the __menu selection__ screen
* The title of __the article__ itself
