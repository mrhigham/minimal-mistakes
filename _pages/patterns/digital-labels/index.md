## Uniform title

Ensure the same title for an object is used in all of the places it is referred to. For example:

* The physical object label positioned by an object
* The title of the digital content on the menu selection screen
* The article of the digital content

## Simple template

* __Menu screen__
* __Detail screen__

### Menu screen

* [Natural mapping](/_pages/principles/layout/) if possible
* If there is a large number of items to select from, consider splitting them into separate menu pages that can be navigated using Previous and Next buttons. Aim to split the items into groups that relate in some way to their physical display (eg, separate cases of objects).

### Detail screen

Actions available:

* Title
