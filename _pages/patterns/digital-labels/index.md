Wireframe showing basic interaction for a digital label: menu screen and detail screen.

### Menu screen

The menu screen forms a key component of the digital label. Content items are presented to the user enabling them to make their selection.

* __Photography:__ Using a photograph of the objects in place is one possible solution to a menu screen as it very clearly links the physical to digital. Be careful to ensure the objects appear interactive (use of buttons) and that the purpose of touching the objects is clear: _Is it obvious what content lives beneath?_
* __Layout:__ Adopt [natural mapping](/_pages/principles/layout/) principles for the graphical layout, if possible.
* __Choice overload:__ If there is a large number of items to select from, consider splitting them into separate menu pages that can be navigated using Previous and Next buttons. Aim to split the items into groups that relate in some way to their physical display (eg, a single menu page for a single display case).

### Detail screen

The detail screen displays the label content. It might contain:

* __Title__ of the object
* __Image__ of the object. Confirm that this story is attached to the physical object. This could be achieved by using an image of the _actual object_ paired with the title _before_ introducing any of the other supporting text of imagery (see #3 of the 'uniform title' image below).

## Uniform title

Use the same title for an object in all of the places it is referred to. For example:

* The __physical object label__ positioned by an object
* The title of the digital content on the __menu selection__ screen
* The title of __the article__ itself

The title of the object is consistent from physical object on the floor (1), to the digital interfaceâ€™s menu (2) and detail screens (3).
