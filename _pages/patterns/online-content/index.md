Create a short URL which redirects to the content’s location. Things to consider with the URL:

* Use this format: __tepapa.govt.nz/unique-identifier__
* Should be memorable and uniquely associated to this specific exhibit/interactive
* Don’t include additional unnecessary branding or organisation jargon (eg, the user doesn’t should have to remember ‘Nga Toi, Arts Te Papa’ at this point)
* Use dashes (-) for spaces. If the URL does require these, create a duplicate URL without the spaces to catch people who forget.

Example of referring to an interactive’s specific content:

__Watch these videos online at tepapa.govt.nz/anzac-prints__


Google Analytics parameters should be added to the destination URL, example:

__http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/nga-toi-arts/anzac-print-gallery?utm_source=APG&utm_medium=interactive&utm_campaign=APG__


Use the parameters as follows:

* `utm_source=` Where was the message that the user read? Was it for an interactive? Or on signage inside the museum? (For example, `museum-exhibit`)
* `utm_medium=` 
* `utm_campaign=` Identify the exhibition involved, if any (for example, `anzac-print-gallery`)


__Consider the user journey your visitor will take.__ Where will they land from this URL? Is it immediately obvious how it is linked to where they saw the URL? Is all relevant content grouped/related/easy to find from here? Will it date well or will this page become redundant before the exhibition is over?
