## Choosing the right method

The right research method can be determined after identifying factors like:

- What *Mode* the project is in?
  - Diverging: Exploring an opportunity or a problem, or brainstorming new ideas
  - Converging: Synthesising lots of data into insights or a project brief, or focusing in on a single solution 
- What *Outputs* are need?
  - More questions? More insights?
  - Prototype designs?
  - Identifying usability problems?
