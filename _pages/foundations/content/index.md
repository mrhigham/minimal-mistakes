## Number of choices

* __Limit choices:__ Too many choices can overwhelm users. Be mindful of the context the screen is in and how this might affect a user’s willingness to consume content. Can you amalgamate any of the choices into one? Be wary of splicing the content into multiple pieces if there isn’t a compelling user reason to. Being too granular and increasing choices can be negative.
* __Discoverability:__ Remember that more content can mean more navigation, which can mean hidden content. A key principle is ‘out of sight, out of mind.’ If a user has to find the content, they are much less likely to engage with it.
* __Play all?__ Consider whether or not a `Play all` action might be useful. (However, if one user started this and then abandoned the screen, would this be detrimental to other users encountering the screen?)
* __Number of interactions required:__ Think about the number of interactions required to consume all of the content presented. This includes interrupting the screensaver, making a selection, closing this content, making a new selection, etc. Lots of interactions and choices make more sense when the user can be seated and the content is in short, sharp bursts. However, if the content is slower to consume (say 1-minute videos or longer) and the user can’t sit down, they could tire and move on before having a good chance to consume the content.

## Length of content

* __No one size fits all.__ The ideal length of content will be based on factors such as:
    * The object/story being told
    * Expected audience that will be attracted to this content/exhibition
    * The spatial positioning of the screen and how this could affect a visitor’s propensity to engage (see Context article).
* __Grab attention immediately.__ We know user’s attention spans are brief However, content must makes grab visitor’s attention very early. Lead with the conclusion / most interesting point (front-load your content / inverted pyramid) if there is one.
* __Watch it later.__ Consider hosting the content online and [referencing it from within the museum](/_pages/patterns/online-content/). This is likely to be particularly useful when there is a lot of related content that unlikley to be consumed at one time within the exhibition, or content that works particularly well outside of the specific context of the museum (eg, more of a thinkpiece).
