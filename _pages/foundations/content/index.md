## Length of content

* While length of content can affect engagement, it would be unhelpful to create rules about this. The optimal length of content will differ based on dimensions of content, space and audience.
* __Discoverability:__ Remember that more content can mean more navigation, which can mean hidden content. A key principle is ‘out of sight, out of mind.’ If a user has to find the content, they are much less likely to engage with it.
