## ‘Surf or serve’

### Surf

‘Surf’ refers to a digital experience in which there are many items of tangentially-related content to consume. The user takes a more autonomous approach and determines the course of their exploration. The result is similar to a website in which the user has the autonomy to seek out information in a non-defined, non-linear fashion.

‘Surfing’ for content is expected to work best when it is detached in some way from an exhibition. Threshold or intermediary spaces, such as entries & exits, a media lounge, the promenade or the cafes, create a different visitor mode which is expected to be more receptive to ‘surfing’ content.

### Serve

‘Serve’ takes a more editorial approach. Content selection is restrained to fewer items. The user is required to make fewer interactions and is presented with a focused, linear narrative. An example would be a screen which presents a single video. The user might only make a single interaction, for example pressing ‘Play’. The content/narrative is then served to the user with no further interactions required.

‘Serve’ content is expected to work best within a full and busy exhibition. The focus of a single narrative which doesn’t require complex, self-driven interaction is analogous to an object placed within a case: the curated and considered narrative is told to the user without requiring them to make choices or decisions.

## ‘Threat of volume’

Is this interactive in a particularly quiet space of the museum? If so, it is possible that some visitors will be more reluctant to engage with it if they are concerned that it could interrupt an otherwise quiet environment.

‘Threat of volume’ refers to this tendency for some visitors to hesitate using an interactive because of the sound it might emit. If an interactive is placed within a particularly quiet environment, consider using headphones to mitigate this risk. Alternatively, consider a less subdued location to position the interactive.
