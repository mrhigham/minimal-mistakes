excerpt: "Collecting data on the use of interactives is a requirement and will ensure we can make more confident and informed decisions in the future to improve our digital outputs."

More stringent documentation on analytics will be written as these are implemented, tested and revised in the near future. In the meantime, use the following as a guide of what data might be tracked and how it could be used.

### Examples of metrics to be recorded:

* Views (pages, video plays, images in a gallery, etc)
* Navigation paths
* Failure points
* Specific tasks/events, for example:
    * Language switching
    * Subtitle use (which languages are used most)
* Social sharing (eg, how often, which platforms)
* Email sign ups
* General error logs

### Examples of what we could learn from these analytics:

* Usage of interactives
    * What is popular? What isn’t?
    * Do certain areas of the museum perform above or below average? Does moving them improve the engagement?
* Trends of exiting interactives
    * Do users exit interactives at predictable points (eg, when first seeing the menu)?
* Which features to support
    * Subtitles – we can learn which languages get used the most to and focus efforts on them
    * Social sharing – which platforms should we support and which ones don’t get used
    * Accessibility menu – is it discoverable and usable?
* Which design patterns promote interaction and which don’t
    * For example, comparing two design patterns over time with A/B testing to see which gets the best engagement
