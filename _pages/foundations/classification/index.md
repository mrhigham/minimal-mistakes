Different classes of interactives present different requirements. These categories cover broad requirements and highlight key differences that might be considered during scoping and development stages.

## Video player

* Particularly low-level of engagement is required. Ideally users should be able to select video content within one touch.
* This is a ‘serve’ experience. The primary question posed to the user is ‘Would you like to watch a video?’ not ‘What would you like to learn?’ Avoid creating a ‘surf’ experience where the user is expected to explore and rummage for content like on a website. Leave that type of experience for outside of the exhibition space. The screen should be considered an object within the exhibition space and curated and edited accordingly.

__‘Threat of volume’:__ Consider how audio could adversely affect the exhibition space, particularly quiet, sombre, or reflective spaces and ways to mitigate it (move screen to a more lively and noisy area, or provide headphones).

__Examples:__ ‘Artists at Work: Richard Stratton’ on Level 6 of _Nga Toi: Arts Te Papa_.

## Digital label

* A digital label should be considered an EOL (Extended Object Label), or more likely, a GEOL (Group Extended Object Label) in the exhibition text hierarchy. * Its purpose is to tell an in-depth story centred on an object in the wider context of the exhibition’s story. However, the way this story is told could through other media, not just text.
* A digital label relies more heavily on the physical object to spark interest in the digital content. It is expected that the user is first drawn to the object and then seeks the deeper analysis from the screen.
* Consider the relationship between the object and the screen and how to make the most of the dynamic between them:
  * Can the object be lit differently when the screen is focused on it? (Think of the Weapons interactive in _Gallipoli_ that lights various weapons in red while the screen shows a video of how that weapon damaged the body.)
  * Can the object be seen clearly from the position of the screen? (Because this relationship is 
  * How do the objects display on the screen clearly?
  * Is it clear when looking at the object that more information about it is present if desired?

__Example:__ The two ‘Arrivals’ digital label kiosks in _Blood Earth Fire_.

## Digital satellite

* A digital satellite contrasts to a digital label by not directly linking to an object within the exhibition. Its content is exclusively located on a screen. For this reason, it requires a clearer introduction than a digital label. A user might be thinking: “What is on this screen? Why is it here?”
* Takes a ‘surf’ approach, rather than ‘serve’ as content is discovered, not immediately presented. Keep the interactive as focused and compact as possible. Consider how many touches are required to access all of the content.
* Consider how it relates to other content in the exhibition text hierarchy, similar to a Segmental, Extended Object Label and a Unique Graphic Solution.
  * On Segmentals: “Keep in mind that many visitors ignore labels that aren’t connected with objects [...] research has indicated that such labels are seldom read as audiences prioritise text connected with objects and images.”
  * On EOL: “Must stand alone as a mini-experience (as if this was the only label the visitor might read in the exhibition), yet avoid annoying level of repetition.”
  * On UGS: “Treatment of a topic that requires a predominantly pictorial or graphic approach to aid interpretation (eg, processes, timelines, maps) [...] Selective use only, not a dumping ground for leftover ideas, stories, or images.”

## Unique digital solution

* Unique set of requirements
* Games / unique content that doesn’t fit one of the other templates

__Examples__ include the Build a Squid game in _The Colossal Squid_ exhibition or the Build a Badge interactve in _Gallipoli_.
