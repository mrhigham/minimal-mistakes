title: "Accessibility"
excerpt: "These are the key guidelines to follow while designing new interactive screens to ensure most visitors can access the content. Like the rest of the DLS, this section will be expanded as more testing of new screens takes place."

## Reach

For wall-mounted screens, all actions should be positioned within the bottom half of the screen. Typically, screens are hung on a 1.5m centre line. New Zealand Access Standards ([NZS 4121:2001](https://www.standards.govt.nz/assets/Publication-files/NZS4121-2001.pdf)) state that people in wheelchairs can typically reach 1350mm from side on (note, this typical reach height is lower when the screen is approached from front on).

### Lower half of mounted screens

As a rule, keep all interactive hotspots in the bottom half of wall-mounted screens to ensure a person in a wheelchair with limited reach can still access them.

### Accessibility controls

Sometimes there might be a compelling reason to have interactive hotspots in the top half of the screen, especially during content selection of multiple items. In this instance, provide a secondary way to navigate the content, such as using an accessible detached set of controls. Visitors will then be able to cycle through content options to select, similar to tabbing through links on a website.

Accessible menu allows for navigation of all content. The signal for the menu is placed in an obvious, easy-to-reach location and signified using an easily recognisable symbol (1); content is navigated using arrow buttons (2 & 3); content is selected (4).
