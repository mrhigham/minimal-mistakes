## Natural Mapping
Where possible, represent the digital content in response to the layout of its related physical object. This doesn’t require an exact 1:1 relationship, but consider how it can reduce the cognitive load of the user to map them in similar layouts (see the example of the stove top controls).

**Note:** A [skeuomorphic result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph) is not the intention, but to make the interface intuitive and obvious so the user doesn’t have to “learn” the interface.

_Example: The stove top on the left is not using natural mapping; there is no obvious relationship between the controls and the burners. The stove top on the right utilises the natural mapping principle: the relationship between each control and burner is obvious and requires no written instruction or ‘trial-and-error’ approach from the user._
