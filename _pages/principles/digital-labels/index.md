title: "Digital labels"
excerpt: "Guidelines for creating digital labels, created for Natural History and History Renewal specifically."
---

As part of the Exhibition Renewal, and principally for the natural environment and history spaces, we’re exploring the use of digital labels to tell stories around objects. They’re intended primarily for object-dense cases (as per _Bug Lab_ insect labels – and even more dense examples), not as a mechanism to tell complex stories (as per _Gallipoli_ soldier stories, which anecdotally receive very little engagement). 

## Why _digital_ labels? 	

Unlike print labels, digital labels can:

* *increase bilingual content without overloading the exhibition with text,* which dramatically reduces engagement (and support reo learning via glossary pop-ups, and image and audio support);
* *include simple multimedia content* (eg, stills, video) as part of the interpretation around objects – ie, bring them to life;
* support a more *active, discovery-based relationship* with the visitor (as observed in _Bug Lab_);
* *support accessibility* – eg, the ability to alter text size or hear an audio version (for sight impaired);
* *reduce the costs of correcting or updating exhibition information* as no reprinting is required (for touring exhibitions, reprinting deteriorated labels costs about $2,000 per venue); and
* *be reused* from one exhibition to the next (for up to 5 years approximately).

With extra investment in the longer term, digital labels also have the potential to support:

* saving and sharing\*
* visitor responses and contributions\*

\*Note: Do audiences actually want this functionality? More research required.

## Guidelines for digital labels

These guidelines apply to _labels connected to multiple objects,_ not stand-alone digital interactives.

1.	**Level of information hierarchy:** Use digital labels at the level of objects only, not introductions (ie, level 3 and below of the information hierarchy). At the upper levels, Māori and English should be displayed permanently alongside one another (te reo first), with equal status and presence, differentiated only by colour.

2.	**Language:** Present text in Māori and English and use the [language toggle component](/_pages/patterns/language-toggle/)  to allow visitors to switch languages. English is presented as the default language and makes use of the [gloss component](/_pages/patterns/gloss/) to encourage English readers to learn te reo words.

Other languages can be implemented, but Māori remains the priority and is presented as the first option in the toggle.

3.	**Placement:** Place the digital labels as close as possible to the relevant objects without obscuring them, and ensure that visitors (including young visitors and those in wheelchairs) can easily reach the screens (see [Accesssibility](/_pages/foundations/accessibility/) for more information on screen placement). A visitor looking at an object should instantly know where to go for information about it.

4.	**Less is more:** Ensure a clear purpose – less is more, as per physical labels. Limit choices, and keep levels of content to two or three layers maximum (including home), because ‘out of sight = out of mind’. (Highly connected or complex content – eg, with multiple links and pathways – is appropriate only in [intermediary spaces like lounges](/_pages/foundations/context/), where visitor behaviour is different.) 

5.	**User interface and accessibility:**

*	Make use of ['natural mapping'](/_pages/principles/layout/) to ensure an exact visual match between what is displayed on screen and the associated content in the exhibition space. 
*	Place navigational icons and other key elements in consistent places across digital labels.
*	Place core ‘object label’ information on or near the surface: descriptor, maker, materials. 
*	Adhere to our [accessibility guidelines](/_pages/foundations/accessibility/) – eg, colour contrast, use of subtitles in video, minimum text size, left-aligned text. 

6.	**Close looking:** Prompt visitors to look back at the real objects: `Notice ...` / `Can you see ...?`

7.	**Text:** Use bite-sized text – 30 to 70 words per page, in short paragraphs. 

8.	**Introductions:** Skip them! Get to the point, with the fewest clicks possible between visitor and content.  

9.	**Links:** Links and hotspots should say where they’ll take you (not simply `Next`, `Previous`, or `Touch here` – see [Call to action](/_pages/principles/call-to-action/)). 

10.	**Extras:** Consider ways to support accessibility (eg, audio, dynamic font sizes, language learning).
