## What is a digital label?

A digital label is an **object-focused** interactive touchscreen that offers interpretation for **objects on display** in the exhibition.

Examples include:

* _Bug Lab_ specimen interactives
* _Blood Earth Fire_ ‘Arrivals’ interactives

Digital labels contrasts with other digital interactives that are story-focused and only relate to objects secondarily, if at all. Typically, these screens receive little ‘deep engagement’ from visitors.

Examples include:

* _Gallipoli_ soldier stories
* _Ko Rongowhakaata_ story-based digital interactives (eg, ‘Te Kooti’ or ’Christian Faith’ interactives)

## Why _digital_ labels?

Unlike print labels, digital labels can:

* **increase bilingual content** without adding to the visual overload of text (which dramatically reduces visitor engagement);
* support **reo learning** via glossary pop-ups with audio support;
* **include multimedia content** (eg, stills, video, image zooming) as part of the interpretation around objects – ie, bring them to life;
* support a more **active, discovery-based relationship** with the visitor (as observed in _Bug Lab_);
* support **accessibility** – eg, ability to alter text size or hear an audio version (for sight impaired); and,
* **reduce the costs of correcting or updating exhibition information** as no reprinting is required.

With extra investment in the longer term, digital labels also have the potential to support saving, sharing and visitor contribution functionality, however more research is required to assess visitor appetite for this.

Guidelines for developing digital labels:

## 1. Object-level only

Use digital labels at the level of objects only, not introductions (ie, level 3 and below of the information hierarchy).

## 2. Broad and shallow

Digital labels will likely represent many objects and therefore have a ‘broad’ scope of choices. However, keep digital labels ‘shallow‘ by only including two or three layers maximum (including home), because ‘out of sight = out of mind’. 

Highly connected or complex content – eg, with multiple links and pathways – is appropriate only in [intermediary spaces like lounges](/_pages/foundations/context/), where visitor behaviour is different.

## 3. Front-load content

Get to the point. Skip introductions and bring the conclusion to the fore. Visitors typically skim-read so place core ‘object label’ information (eg, descriptor, maker, materials) on or near the surface along with a key idea. If secondary, deeper content is also offered, make it available *following* this primary layer.

## 4. Word count

Use bite-sized text – 30 to 70 words per page, in short paragraphs.

## 5. Language

* Digital labels are always bilingual. Use the [language toggle](/_pages/patterns/language-toggle/) to offer text in Māori and English.

* Default the interactive to English, but present Māori as the first option in the toggle

* Make use of the [glosses](/_pages/patterns/gloss/) to encourage English readers to learn te reo words.

## 6. Physical placement

Consider the viewpoint of a visitor directly in front of the object – a visitor should know instantly where to go for information. The digital label should be ‘at hand’ when needed.

Equally, when the visitor is using the digital label, ensure they have a clear line of sight back to the object.

As always, ensure that young visitors and those in wheelchairs can easily reach the screens (see [Accesssibility](/_pages/foundations/accessibility/) for more information on accessible screen placement).

## 7. User interface

  *	Make use of ['natural mapping'](/_pages/principles/layout/) to ensure an exact visual match between what is displayed on screen and the associated content in the exhibition space.
  
  *	Place navigational icons and other key elements in consistent places across digital labels.
 
  *	Adhere to our [accessibility guidelines](/_pages/foundations/accessibility/) – eg, colour contrast, use of subtitles in video, minimum text size.

Consider ways to extend accessibility support, eg, audio, dynamic font sizes, additional languages, extended language learning, etc.

## 8. Encourage close looking

Prompt visitors to look back at the real objects on display: `Notice ...` / `Can you see ...?` / `Look at the ...`

## 9. No 'mystery meat' links

Links should say where they’ll take you. Avoid ambiguous links like `Next`, `Previous`, or `Touch here` – for more on this, see [Call to action](/_pages/principles/call-to-action/).
