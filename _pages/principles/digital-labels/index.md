title: "Digital labels"
excerpt: "Guidelines for creating digital labels, created for Natural History and History Renewal specifically."
---

As part of the Exhibition Renewal, we’re exploring the use of digital labels to tell stories around objects. They’re intended primarily for object-dense cases (as per _Bug Lab_ insect labels, and even more dense examples), not as a mechanism to tell complex stories (as per _Gallipoli_ soldier stories, which anecdotally receive very little engagement). 

**A digital label is an *object-focused* interactive touchscreen that offers interpretation for *objects on display* in the exhibition. It contrasts with other digital interactives that are story-focused or game-based.**

## Why _digital_ labels?

Unlike print labels, digital labels can:

* increase bilingual content without adding to the visual overload of text (which dramatically reduces visitor engagement);
* support reo learning via glossary pop-ups, and image and audio support;
* include multimedia content (eg, stills, video, image zooming) as part of the interpretation around objects – ie, bring them to life;
* support a more active, discovery-based relationship with the visitor (as observed in _Bug Lab_);
* support accessibility – eg, ability to alter text size or hear an audio version (for sight impaired);
* reduce the costs of correcting or updating exhibition information as no reprinting is required; and
* be reused from one exhibition to the next (for up to 5 years approximately).

With extra investment in the longer term, digital labels also have the potential to support saving, sharing and visitor contribution functionality, however more research is required to assess visitor appetite for this.

## 1. Object-level only

Use digital labels at the level of objects only, not introductions (ie, level 3 and below of the information hierarchy).

## 2. Broad and shallow

Digital labels may represent many objects and therefore have a ‘broad’ scope of choices. However, keep digital labels ‘shallow‘ by only including two or three layers maximum (including home), because ‘out of sight = out of mind’. 

Highly connected or complex content – eg, with multiple links and pathways – is appropriate only in [intermediary spaces like lounges](/_pages/foundations/context/), where visitor behaviour is different.

## 3. Front-load content

Get to the point. Skip introductions and bring the conclusion to the fore. Visitors typically skim-read so place core ‘object label’ information (eg, descriptor, maker, materials) on or near the surface along with a key idea. If secondary, deeper content is also offered, make it available *following* this primary layer.

## 4. Word count

Use bite-sized text – 30 to 70 words per page, in short paragraphs.

## 5. Language

Present text in Māori and English and use the [language toggle component](/_pages/patterns/language-toggle/) to allow visitors to switch languages. English is presented as the default language and makes use of the [gloss component](/_pages/patterns/gloss/) to encourage English readers to learn te reo words.

## 6. Physical placement

Consider the viewpoint of a visitor directly in front of the object – a visitor should know instantly where to go for information about it. Position the digital label so it is ‘at hand’ when needed. Equally, when the visitor is using the digital label, ensure they have a clear line of sight back to the object.

Ensure that visitors (including young visitors and those in wheelchairs) can easily reach the screens (see [Accesssibility](/_pages/foundations/accessibility/) for more information on accessible screen placement).

## 7. User interface

  *	Make use of ['natural mapping'](/_pages/principles/layout/) to ensure an exact visual match between what is displayed on screen and the associated content in the exhibition space. 
  *	Place navigational icons and other key elements in consistent places across digital labels.
 
  *	Adhere to our [accessibility guidelines](/_pages/foundations/accessibility/) – eg, colour contrast, use of subtitles in video, minimum text size. 

Consider ways to extend accessibility support, eg, audio, dynamic font sizes, additional languages, extended language learning, etc.

## 8. Encourage close looking

Prompt visitors to look back at the real objects: `Notice ...` / `Can you see ...?`

## 9. No 'mystery meat' links

Links should say where they’ll take you, not simply `Next`, `Previous`, or `Touch here` – more on this, see [Call to action](/_pages/principles/call-to-action/).
