Te Papa wishes collect data around interactive use, in order to ensure the interactive is performing as well as anticipated, and to learn more about our audiences behaviours and expectations to ensure we deliver digital experiences of most value for future product development. We wish to ensure we have appropriate data to help drive decision making and performance assessment. The kind of data needed to be collected will depend on the individual product, but common examples are below.

Examples of metrics to be recorded:

* Call to action/navigation item use element use
* Failure points (non-completion of actions)
* Language switching
